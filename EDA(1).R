# Download any dataset from UCI or Data.org or any other data repositories and perform
# Exploratory data analysis using R

# EDA is an approach for summarizing, visualizing, becoming familiar with the data set

#Exploratory Data Analysis is majorly performed using the following methods:
#1. Univariate Visualization : Summary statistics of each variable in the raw dataset (Data profiling )
#2. Bivariate Visualization : Findout the relationshilp between each variable 
#Ex: a, b,c, d,e,f,  target(class)
#3. multivariate Visualization: 
#4. Dimensional reduction: A process reducing the dataset or selecting the best variables

# Things to do as part of EDA Practically

#1. Distribution
#2. mean()
#3. Mode
#4. Outliers
#5. Standard Deviation (SD)
#6. Correlation
#7. Visulalization
    
 #   Correlation Heat Map
  #  Zoomed Heat Map
   # Pair Plot
    #Scatter Plot
    #Box plot - 
    
    
    #(Write the observations)
    
#8. Estimate Skewness and Kurtosis

#9. Missing Value Analysis
  #Missing values for all numeric features in Bar chart Representation
  #Missing values for Categorical features in Bar chart RepresentationÂ¶
#10.Categorical Feature Exploration
   #(find out unique values of each faeture)
#11. Dimensinality reduction
    #Know the strength of each feature
    #set the threshold
    #filter the features
